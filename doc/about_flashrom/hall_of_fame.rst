============
Hall of Fame
============

This is the flashrom project's hall of fame, where we credit everybody who
has contributed to flashrom's code in the past.

Based on the Git history (dating back to 2002!), this page separately lists all
:ref:`authors <authors>` and :ref:`reviewers <reviewers>` where each line
lists a person's name and how many commits they are credited for. [#svn]_

flashrom is alive and running because of you all, the people who during all
these years (and decades!) give their time, energy, knowledge, and a piece of
their heart to flashrom. The project is what we all are creating together.

**Thank you everyone so much!**

.. _authors:

Authors
=======

The people listed here are those credited as the author or a co-author (as
in ``Co-authored-by`` or ``Co-developed-by``) of at least one Git commit in
flashrom.

.. flashrom-authors:: authors

  This copy of the flashrom documentation was built without
  generating the list of authors. To generate it, ensure
  the :code:`generate_authors_list`
  :ref:`Meson option <meson_configuration>` is enabled when
  building.

.. _reviewers:

Reviewers
=========

The people listed here are those credited as a reviewer (``Reviewed-by``)
of at least one Git commit in flashrom.

We very much appreciate flashrom code reviews; you can read more about it
in our :ref:`code review documentation <support-code-reviews>`.

.. flashrom-authors:: reviewers

  This copy of the flashrom documentation was built without
  generating the list of reviewers. To generate it, ensure
  the :code:`generate_authors_list`
  :ref:`Meson option <meson_configuration>` is enabled when
  building.

.. [#svn] Data for contributions prior to 2017 may be inaccurate or missing,
  because flashrom used SVN rather than Git prior to then and old metadata might
  not be in a format that is understood by the scripts that automatically generate
  this page.
