===============================
Recent development (unreleased)
===============================

This document describes the major changes that are expected to be included in
the next release of flashrom and which are currently only available by source
code checkout (see :doc:`../dev_guide/building_from_source`). These changes
may be further revised before the next release.

Known issues
============

AMD-based PCs with FCH are unable to read flash contents for internal (BIOS
flash) chips larger than 16 MB, and attempting to do so may crash the system.
Systems with AMD "Promontory" IO extenders (mostly "Zen" desktop platforms) are
not currently supported.
