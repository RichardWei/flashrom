==========
FT2232 SPI
==========

flashrom supports the ``-p ft2232_spi`` (or ``-p ft2232spi`` in very old flashrom revisions) option
which allows you to use an FTDI FT2232/FT4232H/FT232H based device as external SPI programmer.

This is made possible by using `libftdi <http://www.intra2net.com/en/developer/libftdi/>`_.
flashrom autodetects the presence of libftdi headers and enables FT2232/FT4232H/FT232H support if they are available.

Currently known FT2232/FT4232H/FT232H based devices which can be used as SPI programmer
together with flashrom are described below.

In order to use the DLP-USB1232H device as SPI programmer you have to setup a small circuit
(e.g. on a breadboard). See the schematics for details (you can also
`download the schematics as PDF <http://www.coreboot.org/images/2/26/Dlp_usb1232h_spi_programmer.pdf>`_
for easier printing).

=============== ======================= =============   ======  ===============================================

Instructions and hints
----------------------

* You must connect/shorten pins 8 and 9, which configures the device to be powered by USB.
  Without this connection it will not be powered, and thus not be detected by your OS
  (e.g. it will not appear in the ``lsusb`` output).

* You need a 3.3V voltage regulator to convert the 5V from USB to 3.3V,
  so you can power the 3.3V SPI BIOS chip.

  * You can probably use pretty much any 3.3V voltage regulator, e.g. **LD33V** or **LD1117xx**.
    For usage on a breadboard the TO-220 packaging is probably most useful.
  * You have to connect two capacitors (e.g. 100nF and 10uF as per datasheets,
    but using two 10uF capacitors, or even two 47uF capacitors also works in practice) as shown in the schematics,
    otherwise the voltage regulator will not work correctly and reliably.

* Connect the following pins from the DLP-USB1232H to the SPI BIOS chip:

  * **18 (SK)** to **SCLK**
  * **16 (DO)** to **SI**
  * **2 (DI)** to **SO**
  * **5 (CS)** to **CS#**
  * The **WP# and HOLD#** pins should be tied to **VCC**! If you leave them unconnected
    you'll likely experience strange issues.
  * All **GND** pins should be connected together (**pins 1i and 10** on the DLP-USB1232H,
    **pin 8** on the SPI chip, **pin 1** on the voltage regulator).

You have to invoke flashrom with the following parameters::

  $ flashrom -p ft2232_spi:type=2232H,port=A

========================

The `FTDI FT2232H Mini-Module Evaluation Kit <http://www.ftdichip.com/Products/Modules/DevelopmentModules.htm#FT2232H%20Mini%20Module>`_
(`the datasheet <http://www.ftdichip.com/Support/Documents/DataSheets/Modules/DS_FT2232H_Mini_Module.pdf>`_)
can be used with flashrom for programming SPI chips.

FTDI FT4232H Mini-Module
========================

The `FTDI FT4232H Mini-Module Evaluation Kit <http://www.ftdichip.com/Products/Modules/DevelopmentModules.htm#FT4232H%20Mini%20Module>`_
(`datasheet <http://www.ftdichip.com/Support/Documents/DataSheets/Modules/DS_FT4232H_Mini_Module.pdf>`_)
can be used with flashrom for programming SPI chips.

Olimex ARM-USB-TINY/-H and ARM-USB-OCD/-H
=========================================

The `Olimex <http://www.olimex.com/dev/index.html>`_ `ARM-USB-TINY <http://www.olimex.com/dev/arm-usb-tiny.html>`_
(VID:PID 15BA:0004) and `ARM-USB-OCD <http://www.olimex.com/dev/arm-usb-ocd.html>`_ (15BA:0003)
can be used with flashrom for programming SPI chips.
The `ARM-USB-TINY-H <http://www.olimex.com/dev/arm-usb-tiny-h.html>`_ (15BA:002A)
and `ARM-USB-OCD-H <http://www.olimex.com/dev/arm-usb-ocd-h.html>`_ (15BA:002B) should also work,
though the tested status is unconfirmed.

The following setup can then be used to flash a BIOS chip through SPI.

Pinout:

 .. image:: ARM-USB-TINY_pinout.png

=============== =========================
Pin (JTAG Name)	SPI/Voltage Source
=============== =========================
1 (VREF)	VCC (from Voltage Source)
2 (VTARGET)	VCC (to SPI target)
4 (GND)		GND (from Voltage Source)
5 (TDI)		SI
6 (GND)		GND (to SPI target)
7 (TMS)		CE#
9 (TCK)		SCK
13 (TDO)	SO
=============== =========================

On the ARM-USB-TINY, VREF, and VTARGET are internally connected, and all the GND lines
(even numbered pins, from 4 to 20) share the same line as well, so they can be used
to split VCC/GND between the voltage source and the target.

The voltage source should provide 3.0V to 3.3V DC but doesn't have to come from USB:
it can be as simple as two AA or AAA batteries placed in serial (2 x 1.5V).

Invoking flashrom
-----------------

You first need to add the ``-p ft2232_spi`` option, and then specify one of ``arm-usb-tiny``,
``arm-usb-tiny-h``, ``arm-usb-ocd`` or ``arm-usb-ocd-f`` for the type.
For instance, to use an ARM-USB-TINY, you would use::

  $ flashrom -p ft2232_spi:type=arm-usb-tiny

Openmoko
========

The openmoko debug board (which can also do serial+jtag for the openmoko phones, or for other phones)
has `its shematics available here <http://people.openmoko.org/joerg/schematics/debug_board/OpenMoKo_Debug_Board_V3_MP.pdf>`_.

Informations
------------

The openmoko debug board can act as an SPI programmer bitbanging the FTDI
(no need of an openmoko phone), you just need:

* a breadboard
* some wires
* The openmoko debug board(v2 and after,but only tested with v3)

The voltage is provided by the board itself. The connector to use is the JTAG one
(very similar to what's documented in the previous section(Olimex ARM-USB-TINY/-H and ARM-USB-OCD/-H )

Building
--------

**WARNING: This was tested with 3.3v chips only.**

Here's the pinout of the JTAG connector of the openmoko debug board
(copied from ARM-USB-tiny because it's the same pinout):

 .. image:: ARM-USB-TINY_pinout.png

=============== =============================== ========================
Pin (JTAG Name)	SPI/Voltage Source		BIOS Chip connector name
=============== =============================== ========================
1 (VREF)	VCC (from Voltage Source)	VCC (3.3v only)
2 (VTARGET)	VCC (to SPI target)		Not connected
4 (GND)		GND (from Voltage Source)	Ground
5 (TDI)		SI				DIO (Data Input)
6 (GND)		GND (to SPI target)		Not connected
7 (TMS)		CE#				CS (Chip select)
9 (TCK)		SCK				CLK (Clock)
13 (TDO)	SO				DO (Data output)
=============== =============================== ========================

* Also connect the BIOS chip's write protect(WP) to VCC

* Also connect the BIOS chips's HOLD to VCC
